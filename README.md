Handwritten Digit & Letter Recognition (Final Year Project)

This project is my Final Year Project for BS Computer Science, focused on machine learning for handwritten digit and alphabet recognition.

📌 Overview

Developed a custom neural network for classifying handwritten digits (MNIST) and letters (EMNIST).

Includes a Python backend for training and inference.

Includes a JavaScript/React interface for user interaction and testing predictions.

Supports real-time digit/letter drawing using a simple GUI.

📂 Project Contents

Source Code

Python scripts (model training, evaluation, inference).

JavaScript/React frontend (UI for digit drawing & recognition).

Documentation

Project report.

Presentation slides.

⚠️ Note: The repository does not include:

Dataset files (MNIST/EMNIST).

Pre-trained model parameters (.json).

If you wish to use or test this project, you will need to:

Download MNIST / EMNIST datasets.

Train the neural network using the provided training scripts.

Save the model parameters in .json format for inference.

🚀 Features

Digit recognition (0–9).

Alphabet recognition (A–Z).

Custom-built neural network implementation (no TensorFlow/PyTorch for core training).

Interactive drawing board for real-time predictions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python (NumPy, Tkinter) – Model training & GUI.

JavaScript (React) – Web-based frontend.

PostgreSQL – (if used, mention database features here).

📖 Usage

Clone the repo.

Install dependencies (listed in requirements.txt / package.json).

Prepare dataset.

Train the model.

Run the app to test digit/letter recognition.
